***
### Key Function
- Multi-type PTM prediction – supports 17 types of modifications
- Hybrid model architecture – combining Transformer and CNN
- Integration of the ESM-2 protein language model
- Incorporation of structural features – including secondary structure, solvent accessibility, etc.
- Support for imbalanced datasets

***

2. Train:
   ```
   python main.py 
   ```


***
### Demo
 
  Since prediction requires the incorporation of structural information, PyRosetta needs to be downloaded separately. Below is the download code from the PyRosetta official website.
  
     
     pip install pyrosetta-installer 
     python -c 'import pyrosetta_installer; pyrosetta_installer.install_pyrosetta()'
     

1. Get predictions for the tau protein:

   ```python
   python case.py
   ```

***
### Jupyter Notebook
 
   We have also prepared a Jupyter Notebook for interactively predicting post-translational modification (PTM) sites, allowing users to explore the model's capabilities in a more hands-on and intuitive way. Check predict.ipynb for more detail.
  
   ```shell
   predict.ipynb
   ```  
     
***

### Predict

1. Download the ESM model checkpoint files from [esm model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KYbfh3PGRhd_s0wn-8tZcbX_uvo1xdNm?usp=drive_link) and place in the /DeepPTMPred directory .

2. Data Preparation:

   a. ESM Features:
   
   ```shell
   python e2_single_data.py
   ```  

   b. Structual Features:
   
   Download the corresponding PDB files from AlphaFold DB and place them in DeepPTMPred/data directory


4. Update Configuration
Before running the prediction, you need to configure the following key parameters in predict.py:

    - ptm_type
   
      Specify the type of post-translational modification (PTM) to predict.Supported types include: 'phosphorylation', 'acetylation', 'ubiquitination', etc.
   
      ```shell
      Example: ptm_type = 'phosphorylation'
      ``` 

   - model_path

      Path to the trained model weights file (.h5 ).

      Make sure use the model corresponds to the selected ptm_type.
     
      ```shell
      Example: model_path = "./DeepPTMPred/pred/train_PTM/model/models_phosphorylation_esm2/ptm_data_210_39_64_best_model.h5"
      ``` 
    
   - pdb_path:
   
      File path to the input PDB structure. The script will automatically extract the protein sequence and structural features (e.g., SASA, secondary structure, plDDT) from this file.
   
      Supported formats: AlphaFold-style PDB files (e.g., AF-P31749-F1-model_v4.pdb).
     
      ```shell
      Example: pdb_path = "./DeepPTMPred/data/AF-P31749-F1-model_v4.pdb"
      ``` 


6. Run predictions:
   
   Execute the script to generate predictions:

   ```
   python predict.py 
   ```
